In this project, we created a Bengali caption generator for images using the Transformer architecture from the paper __["Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044)__. 

Model architecture is explained in details in the presentation slide in the **submissions** folder. Dataset and the paper we followed is also mentioned in the attached slide.
